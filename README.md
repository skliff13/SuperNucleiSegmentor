# SuperNucleiSegmentor

A software tool used for fast semi-automated segmentation of cell nuclei on fluorescent microscopy images.

The tool uses SLIC superpixels (Achanta et al., PAMI'12, vol. 34, num. 11, pp. 2274-2282) for speeding up the process of manual segmentation of nuclei. 
C++ implementation by Pascal Mettes was employed. 

### Note

The tool was disegned to work with specific data. 
Interface for loading the data must be re-written for usage.
